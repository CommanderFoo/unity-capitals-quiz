  info: "Port Moresby is the capital and largest city of Papua New Guinea and the
    largest city in the South Pacific outside of Australia and New Zealand. It is
    located on the shores of the Gulf of Papua, on the south-western coast of the
    Papuan Peninsula of the island of New Guinea. The city emerged as a trade centre

    point and air base to cut off Australia from Southeast Asia and the Americas."
