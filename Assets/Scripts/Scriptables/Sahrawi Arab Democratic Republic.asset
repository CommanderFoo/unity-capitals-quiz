  info: "La\xE2youne is the largest city of the disputed territory of Western Sahara
    and de facto administered by Morocco. The modern city is thought to have been
    founded by the Spanish colonizer Antonio de Oro in 1938. In 1940, Spain designated
    it as the capital of the Spanish Sahara. La\xE2youne (El-Aai\xFAn) is the capital
    of the La\xE2youne-Sakia El Hamra region administered by Morocco under the supervision
    of the UN peace-keeping mission in Western Sahara (MINURSO).\n\nTifariti is an
    oasis town located in north-eastern Western Sahara, east of the Moroccan Berm,
    138 km (86 mi) from Smara and 15 km (9 mi) north of the Mauritanian border. It
    is part of what Polisario Front call the Liberated Territories and Morocco call
    the Buffer Zone. It has been the de facto temporary capital of the Sahrawi Arab
    Democratic Republic since the government moved there in 2008 from Bir Lehlou.
    It is the headquarters of the 2nd military region of the SADR."
