  info: "Tokyo is one of the 47 prefectures of Japan. It served as the Japanese capital
    since 1869. As of 2018, the Greater Tokyo Area ranked as the most populous metropolitan
    area in the world. The urban area houses the seat of the Emperor of Japan, of
    the Japanese government and of the National Diet. Tokyo forms part of the Kant\u014D
    region on the southeastern side of Japan's main island, Honshu, and includes
    the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Tokyo was formerly named Edo when Sh\u014Dgun
    Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters in 1603. It became the capital
    after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from Kyoto in 1868; at that time
    Edo was renamed Tokyo. The Tokyo Metropolis formed in 1943 from the merger of
    the former Tokyo Prefecture (\u6771\u4EAC\u5E9C T\u014Dky\u014D-fu) and the city
    of Tokyo (\u6771\u4EAC\u5E02 T\u014Dky\u014D-shi). Tokyo is often referred to
    as a city but is officially known and governed as a \"metropolitan prefecture\",
    which differs from and combines elements of a city and a prefecture, a characteristic
    unique to Tokyo."
