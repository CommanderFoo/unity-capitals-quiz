  info: Manila is the capital and highly urbanized city of the Philippines. It is
    one of the oldest cities in the world, as well as the most densely populated
    city proper in the world as of 2018. It was the first chartered city by virtue
    of the Philippine Commission Act 183 on July 31, 1901 and gained autonomy with
    the passage of Republic Act No. 409 or the "Revised Charter of the City of Manila"
    on June 18, 1949. Manila, alongside Mexico City and Madrid are considered the
    world's original set of Global Cities due to Manila's commercial networks being
    the first to traverse the Pacific Ocean, thus connecting Asia with the Spanish
    Americas, marking the first time in world history when an uninterrupted chain
    of trade routes circled the planet. Manila has been damaged by and rebuilt from
    wars more times than the famed city of Troy and it is also the second most natural
    disaster-afflicted capital city in the world next to Tokyo, yet it is simultaneously
    among the most populous and wealthiest cities in Southeast Asia.
