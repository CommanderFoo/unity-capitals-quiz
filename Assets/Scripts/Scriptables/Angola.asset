  info: "Luanda, formerly named S\xE3o Paulo da Assun\xE7\xE3o de Loanda, is the
    capital and largest city in Angola, It is Angola's primary port, and its major
    industrial, cultural and urban centre. Located on Angola's northern coast with
    the Atlantic Ocean, Luanda is both Angola's chief seaport and its administrative
    centre. It is also the capital city of Luanda Province. Luanda and its metropolitan
    area is the most populous Portuguese-speaking capital city in the world, with
    over 8 million inhabitants in 2019 (a third of Angola's population). Among the
    oldest colonial cities of Africa, it was founded in January 1576 by Portuguese
    explorer Paulo Dias de Novais, under the name of S\xE3o Paulo da Assun\xE7\xE3o
    de Loanda. The city served as the centre of the slave trade to Brazil before
    its prohibition. At the start of the Angolan Civil War in 1975, most of the white
    Portuguese left as refugees, principally for Portugal. Luanda's population increased
    greatly from refugees fleeing the war, but its infrastructure was inadequate
    to handle the increase. This also caused the exacerbation of slums, or musseques,
    around Luanda. The city is currently undergoing a major reconstruction, with
    many large developments taking place that will alter its cityscape significantly."
