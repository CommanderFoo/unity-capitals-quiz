  info: 'Vatican City is an independent city-state enclaved within Rome, Italy. Established
    with the Lateran Treaty (1929), it is distinct from, yet under "full ownership,
    exclusive dominion, and sovereign authority and jurisdiction" of the Holy See
    (Latin: Sancta Sedes). With an area of 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population
    of about 1,000, it is the smallest sovereign state in the world by both area
    and population.'
