  info: Saint Helier is one of the twelve parishes of Jersey, the largest of the
    Channel Islands in the English Channel. St Helier has a population of about 33,500,
    roughly 34.2% of the total population of Jersey, and is the capital of the Island
    (although Government House is situated in St Saviour). The urban area of the
    parish of St Helier makes up most of the largest town in Jersey, although some
    of the town area is situated in adjacent St Saviour, with suburbs sprawling into
    St Lawrence and St Clement. The greater part of St Helier is rural.
