  info: Tripoli is the capital city and the largest city of Libya, with a population
    of about 1.158 million people in 2018. It is located in the northwest of Libya
    on the edge of the desert, on a point of rocky land projecting into the Mediterranean
    Sea and forming a bay. It includes the port of Tripoli and the country's largest
    commercial and manufacturing centre. It is also the site of the University of
    Tripoli. The vast Bab al-Azizia barracks, which includes the former family estate
    of Muammar Gaddafi, is also located in the city. Colonel Gaddafi largely ruled
    the country from his residence in this barracks.
