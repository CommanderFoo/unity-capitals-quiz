  info: West Island is the capital of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The population
    is roughly 120 and consists mainly of Europeans. It is the less populous of the
    two inhabited islands (the other is Home Island). It was part of the Clunies-Ross
    plantation and an airstrip was built here during World War II. As well as all
    the government buildings, it contains the airport, a general store and tourist
    accommodation. In November 2013 it was revealed that the Australian Signals Directorate
    operates a listening station on West Island.Wullenweber and Adcock antenna systems
    as well as two satellite dish antennae are clearly visible via Google satellite
    view.
