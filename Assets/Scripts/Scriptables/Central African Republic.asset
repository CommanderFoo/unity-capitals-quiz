  info: 'Bangui is the capital and largest city of the Central African Republic.
    As of 2012 it had an estimated population of 734,350. It was established as a
    French outpost in 1889 and named after its location on the northern bank of the
    Ubangi River (French: Oubangui); the Ubangi itself was named from the Bobangi
    word for the "rapids" located beside the settlement, which marked the end of
    navigable water north from Brazzaville. The majority of the population of the
    Central African Republic lives in the western parts of the country, in Bangui
    and the surrounding area.'
