  info: "Cairo is the capital of Egypt. The city's metropolitan area is one of the
    largest in Africa, the largest in the Middle East and 15th-largest in the world,
    and is associated with ancient Egypt, as the famous Giza pyramid complex and
    the ancient city of Memphis are located in its geographical area. Located near
    the Nile Delta, modern Cairo was founded in 969\_AD by the Fatimid dynasty, but
    the land composing the present-day city was the site of ancient national capitals
    whose remnants remain visible in parts of Old Cairo. Cairo has long been a centre
    of the region's political and cultural life, and is titled \"the city of a thousand
    minarets\" for its preponderance of Islamic architecture. Cairo is considered
    a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification according to GaWC."
