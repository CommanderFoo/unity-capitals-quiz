  info: The City of Brussels is the largest municipality and historical centre of
    the Brussels-Capital Region, and the capital of Belgium. Besides the strict centre,
    it also covers the immediate northern outskirts where it borders municipalities
    in Flanders. It is the administrative centre of the European Union, thus often
    dubbed, along with the region, the EU's capital city.
