  country: Burundi
  capital: Gitega
  info: "Gitega is the capital and one of the largest cities in Burundi. Located
    in the centre of the country, in the Burundian central plateau roughly 62 kilometres
    (39\_mi) east by south of Bujumbura (the former capital and largest city), Gitega
    was the seat of the Kingdom of Burundi until its abolition in 1966. In late December
    2018, Burundian president Pierre Nkurunziza announced that he would follow on
    a 2007 promise to return Gitega its former political capital status, with Bujumbura
    remaining as economical capital and centre of commerce. A vote in the Parliament
    of Burundi made the change official on 16 January 2019, with all branches of
    government expected to move in over three years."
