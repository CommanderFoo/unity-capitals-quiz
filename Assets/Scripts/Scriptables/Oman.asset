  info: "Muscat is the capital and largest city of Oman. It is the seat of the Governorate
    of Muscat. According to the National Centre for Statistics and Information (NCSI),
    the total population of Muscat Governorate reached 1.4 million as of September
    2018. The metropolitan area spans approximately 3,500\_km2 (1,400\_sq\_mi) and
    includes six provinces called wilayats. Known since the early 1st century CE
    as an important trading port between the west and the east, Muscat was ruled
    by various indigenous tribes as well as foreign powers such as the Persians,
    the Portuguese Empire, the Iberian Union and the Ottoman Empire at various points
    in its history. A regional military power in the 18th century, Muscat's influence
    extended as far as East Africa and Zanzibar. As an important port-town in the
    Gulf of Oman, Muscat attracted foreign tradesmen and settlers such as the Persians
    and the Balochis. Since the ascension of Qaboos bin Said as Sultan of Oman in
    1970, Muscat has experienced rapid infrastructural development that has led to
    the growth of a vibrant economy and a multi-ethnic society. Muscat is termed
    as a Global City."
