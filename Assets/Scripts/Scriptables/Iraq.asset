  info: Baghdad is the capital of Iraq. Located along the Tigris River, the city
    was founded in the 8th century and became the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate.
    Within a short time of its inception, Baghdad evolved into a significant cultural,
    commercial, and intellectual center for the Islamic world. This, in addition
    to housing several key academic institutions (e.g., House of Wisdom), as well
    as hosting multiethnic and multireligious environment, garnered the city a worldwide
    reputation as the "Centre of Learning".
