  info: Singapore  is a sovereign island city-state in Southeast Asia. It lies one
    degree (137 kilometres or 85 miles) north of the equator, at the southern tip
    of the Malay Peninsula, with Indonesia's Riau Islands to the south and Peninsular
    Malaysia to the north. Singapore's territory consists of one main island along
    with 62 other islets. Since independence, extensive land reclamation has increased
    its total size by 23% (130 square kilometres or 50 square miles).
