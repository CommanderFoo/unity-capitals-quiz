  info: "Naypyidaw is the capital city of Myanmar. The city is located at the center
    of the Naypyidaw Union Territory. It is unusual among Myanmar's cities, being
    an entirely planned city outside of any state or region, similar to Canberra
    in Australia, Bras\xEDlia in Brazil, Washington, D.C. in the United States, Islamabad
    in Pakistan or Abuja in Nigeria. The city officially replaced Yangon as the administrative
    capital of Myanmar in 2006."
