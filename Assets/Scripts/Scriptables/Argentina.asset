  info: "Buenos Aires is the capital and largest city of Argentina. The city is located
    on the western shore of the estuary of the R\xEDo de la Plata, on the South American
    continent's southeastern coast. \"Buenos Aires\" can be translated as \"fair
    winds\" or \"good airs\", but the former was the meaning intended by the founders
    in the 16th century, by the use of the original name \"Real de Nuestra Se\xF1ora
    Santa Mar\xEDa del Buen Ayre\". The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also
    includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most
    populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 15.6\_million."
