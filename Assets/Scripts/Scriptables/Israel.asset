  info: "Jerusalem is a city in the Middle East, located on a plateau in the Judaean
    Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest
    cities in the world, and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions\u2014Judaism,
    Christianity, and Islam. Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority claim Jerusalem
    as their capital, as Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there
    and the State of Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power; however,
    neither claim is widely recognized internationally."
