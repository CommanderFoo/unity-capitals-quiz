    (87.13\_sq\_mi) with an estimated urban population of 2.27\_million as of 2012.
    It is organized into 12 local government districts \u2013 11 municipal districts
    and the Accra Metropolitan District, which is the only district within the capital
    to be granted city status. \"Accra\" usually refers to the Accra Metropolitan

    rest of the capital as the \"City of Accra\". In common usage, however, the terms
