  info: "Stockholm is the capital of Sweden and the most populous urban area in the
    Nordic countries; 965,232 people live in the municipality, approximately 1.6
    million in the urban area, and 2.4 million in the metropolitan area. The city
    stretches across fourteen islands where Lake M\xE4laren flows into the Baltic
    Sea. Outside the city to the east, and along the coast, is the island chain of
    the Stockholm archipelago. The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in
    the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city in 1252 by Swedish statesman
    Birger Jarl. It is also the county seat of Stockholm County."
