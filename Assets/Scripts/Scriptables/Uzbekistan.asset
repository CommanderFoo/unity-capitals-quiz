  info: Tashkent is the capital and largest city of Uzbekistan, as well as the most
    populated city in ex-Soviet Central Asia with a population in 2018 of 2,485,900.
    It is located in the north-east of the country close to the Kazakhstan border.
    Much of the city was destroyed in the 1966 Tashkent earthquake, though it was
    rebuilt afterwards as a model Soviet city.
