  info: "San Juan is the capital and most populous municipality in the Commonwealth
    of Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States. As of the 2010
    census, it is the 46th-largest city under the jurisdiction of the United States,
    with a population of 395,326. San Juan was founded by Spanish colonists in 1521,
    who called it Ciudad de Puerto Rico (\"Rich Port City\"). Puerto Rico's capital
    is the third oldest European-established capital city in the Americas, after
    Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic, founded in 1496 and Panama City, in
    Panama, founded in 1519. Several historical buildings are located in San Juan;
    among the most notable are the city's former defensive forts, Fort San Felipe
    del Morro and Fort San Crist\xF3bal, and La Fortaleza, the oldest executive mansion
    in continuous use in the Americas."
