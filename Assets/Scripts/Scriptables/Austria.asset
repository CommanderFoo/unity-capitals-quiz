  info: "Vienna is the federal capital, largest city and one of nine states of Austria.
    Vienna is Austria's primate city, with a population of about 1.9\_million (2.6\_million
    within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of the country's population),
    and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city
    by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of
    the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before
    the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million
    inhabitants. Today it is the second largest German-speaking city after Berlin
    and just before Hamburg. Vienna is host to many major international organizations,
    including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part
    of Austria and is close to the borders of Czechia, Slovakia, and Hungary. These
    regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby
    Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3\_million inhabitants. In
    2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In July 2017
    it was moved to the list of World Heritage in Danger."
