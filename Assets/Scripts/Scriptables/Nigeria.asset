  info: "Abuja is the capital city of Nigeria located in the centre of the country
    within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). It is a planned city and was built
    mainly in the 1980s, replacing the country's most populous city of Lagos as the
    capital on 12 December 1991. Abuja's geography is defined by Aso Rock, a 400-metre
    (1,300\_ft) monolith left by water erosion. The Presidential Complex, National
    Assembly, Supreme Court and much of the city extend to the south of the rock.
    Zuma Rock, a 792-metre (2,598\_ft) monolith, lies just north of the city on the
    expressway to Kaduna."
