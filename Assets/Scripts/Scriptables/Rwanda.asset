  info: Kigali is the capital and largest city of Rwanda. It is near the nation's
    geographic centre. The city has been Rwanda's economic, cultural, and transport
    hub since it became capital at independence in 1962. The city hosts the main
    residence and offices of the President of Rwanda and government ministries. The
    city is within the province of Kigali City, which was enlarged in January 2006,
    as part of local government reorganisation in the country. Kigali's city limits
    cover the whole province; it is consolidated. The city's urban area covers about
    70% of the municipal boundaries.
