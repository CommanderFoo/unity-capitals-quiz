  info: "Caracas is the capital and largest city of Venezuela, and centre of the
    Greater Caracas Area. Caracas is located along the Guaire River in the northern
    part of the country, following the contours of the narrow Caracas Valley on the
    Venezuelan coastal mountain range (Cordillera de la Costa). Terrain suitable
    for building lies between 760 and 1,140\_m (2,490 and 3,740\_ft) above sea level,
    although there is some settlement above this range. The valley is close to the
    Caribbean Sea, separated from the coast by a steep 2,200-metre-high (7,200\_ft)
    mountain range, Cerro El \xC1vila; to the south there are more hills and mountains.
    The Metropolitan Region of Caracas has an estimated population of 2.923.201."
