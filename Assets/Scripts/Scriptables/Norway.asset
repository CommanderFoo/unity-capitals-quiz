  info: "Oslo is the capital and most populous city of Norway. It constitutes both
    a county and a municipality. Founded in the year 1040 as \xC1nslo, and established
    as a kaupstad or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada, the city was elevated
    to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal
    unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 reduced its
    influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, during the reign of King
    Christian IV, a new city was built closer to Akershus Fortress and named Christiania
    in the king's honour. It was established as a municipality (formannskapsdistrikt)
    on 1 January 1838. The city functioned as a co-official capital during the 1814
    to 1905 Union between Sweden and Norway. In 1877, the city's name was respelled
    Kristiania in accordance with an official spelling reform\_\u2013 a change that
    was taken over by the municipal authorities only in 1897. In 1925 the city, after
    incorporating the village retaining its former name, was renamed Oslo."
