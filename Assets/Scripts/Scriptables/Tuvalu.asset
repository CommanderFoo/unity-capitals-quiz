  info: "Funafuti is an atoll and the capital of the island nation of Tuvalu. It
    has a population of 6,025 people, making it the country's most populated atoll,
    with 56.6 percent of Tuvalu's population. It is a narrow sweep of land between
    20 and 400 metres (66 and 1,312 feet) wide, encircling a large lagoon (Te Namo)
    18\_km (11 miles) long and 14\_km (9 miles) wide. The average depth in the Funafuti
    lagoon is about 20 fathoms (36.5 metres or 120 feet). With a surface of 275 square
    kilometres (106.2\_sq\_mi), it is by far the largest lagoon in Tuvalu. The land
    area of the 33 islets aggregates to 2.4 square kilometres (0.9\_sq\_mi), less
    than one percent of the total area of the atoll. Cargo ships can enter Funafuti's
    lagoon and dock at the port facilities on Fongafale."
