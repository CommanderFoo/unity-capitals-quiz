  info: "Charlotte Amalie is the capital and the largest city of the United States
    Virgin Islands, founded in 1666 as Taphus (meaning \"beer house\" or \"beer hall\").
    In 1691, the town was renamed to Charlotte Amalie after Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel
    (1650\u20131714), queen consort to King Christian V of Denmark-Norway. It has
    a deep-water harbor that was once a haven for pirates and is now one of the busiest
    ports of call for cruise ships in the Caribbean, with about 1.5 million/plus
    cruise ship passengers landing there annually. Protected by Hassel Island, the
    harbor has docking and fueling facilities, machine shops, and shipyards and was
    a U.S. submarine base until 1966. The Town has been inhabited for centuries.
    When Christopher Columbus arrived in 1493, the area was inhabited by Caribs,
    Arawaks, Ciboney and Ta\xEDno native peoples. It is on the southern shore at
    the head of Saint Thomas Harbor. In 2010 the City had a population of 18,481,
    which makes it the largest city in the Virgin Islands Archipelago. Hundreds of
    ferries and yachts pass by the Town each week."
