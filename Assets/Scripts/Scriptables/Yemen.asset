  info: "Sana\u02BDa is the largest city in Yemen and the centre of Sana\u02BDa Governorate.
    The city is not part of the Governorate, but forms the separate administrative
    district of \"Amanat Al-Asemah\". Under the Yemeni constitution, Sana\u02BDa
    is the capital of the country, although the seat of the internationally recognised
    government moved to Aden in the aftermath of the September 21 Revolution. Aden
    was declared as the temporary capital by President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi in March
    2015.\n\nAden is a port city and the temporary capital of Yemen, located by the
    eastern approach to the Red Sea (the Gulf of Aden), some 170 km (110 mi) east
    of Bab-el-Mandeb. Its population is approximately 800,000 people. Aden's natural
    harbour lies in the crater of a dormant volcano, which now forms a peninsula
    joined to the mainland by a low isthmus. This harbour, Front Bay, was first used
    by the ancient Kingdom of Awsan between the 5th and 7th centuries BC. The modern
    harbour is on the other side of the peninsula. Aden gives its name to the Gulf
    of Aden.\n\n"
