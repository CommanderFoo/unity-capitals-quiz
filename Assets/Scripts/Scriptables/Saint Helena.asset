  capital: Jamestown
  info: Jamestown is the capital of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena,
    Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, located on the island of Saint Helena in the
    South Atlantic Ocean. It is also the historic main settlement of the island and
    is on its north-western coast. It is the island's only port and the centre of
    the island's road and communications network. It was founded when colonists from
    the English East India Company settled on the island in 1659 and was briefly
    occupied by the Dutch East India Company in 1673 before being recaptured. Many
    of the buildings built by the East India Company in the 1700s survive and give
    the town its distinctive Georgian flavour.
